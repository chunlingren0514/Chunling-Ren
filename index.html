            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p href="#">Project 1: Our team had found and reported that among the 52 natural withanolides isolated from P. minima and P. angulata L. var. villosa, the antitumor activity of Withangulatin A (WA) is remarkable. In order to find more efficient and less toxic anti-tumor compounds, in this paper, the structural modification of withangulatin A were studied on the basis of the previous work. According to chemical synthesis, separation, purification and spectroscopy analysis, connected different heterocyclic ring at C-4 of WA, 3 new withangulatin A derivatives were obtained (R1-3). The antitumor activity of 3 derivatives was screened and evaluated, using osteosarcoma cells line U2OS as the research object. The results show that all of 3 derivatives showed the better antitumor activities than that of WA, and the R1 has been improved 33 times of WA. The current data suggest that the heterocyclic ring and the fluorine atom that were introduced could have a positive effect on biological activity. In conclusion, this paper may provide valuable data for the research and the development of Withanolides.</p>
            <p href="#">Project 2: Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) was initially identified as a flavin adenine dinucleotide-based amino oxidase with epigenetic effects. Because LSD1 acts on some nonhistone substrates, such as myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, E2F transcription factor 1, and p53, it is a potential therapeutic target. Resently, LSD1 has been reported to be overexpressed in many tumors, including breast, lung, prostate, esophageal, and gastric cancers. To date, almost all reported LSD1 inhibitors have been chemosynthesized; however, natural products possess pharmacological and biological activity and can be sources for drug development. Here, we established a target separation countercurrent chromatography technique to isolate LSD1 inhibitors from zedoary turmeric oil. Four sesquiterpene-based LSD1 inhibitors were efficiently obtained with an inhibition ratio equal to or less than that of the positive control drug. Isogermafurenolide showed the most potent inhibitory activity, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 3.97 μM, and was further tested to determine its ability to inhibit LSD1 and its antitumor metastatic effects in MDA-MB-231 cells. These four compounds are the first sesquiterpene-based natural LSD1 inhibitors to be characterized. Our findings provide a new molecular framework for studying LSD1 inhibitors and offer a template for designing more sesquiterpene-based LSD1 inhibitors with potential antitumor activity. </p>
            <p href="#">Project 3: With the development of redox-related therapy modalities in cancer therapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has gradually become the most widely used type in the clinic. However, The rapid proliferation of tumor cells consumes a large amount of tissue oxygen, which constitutes an inherent characteristic in tumors. The abnormal structure and function of tumor tissues limit O2 delivery, resulting in a hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. While, the hypoxic tumor microenvironment restricted the curative effect of PDT. Here, a strategic hypoxia relief nanodrug delivery system (SHRN) with a synergetic strategy was designed to alleviate tumor hypoxia on the basis of PDT. Specifically, the oxygen producer MnO2, oxygen consumption inhibitor atovaquone (ATO) and photosensitizer hypericin (HY) were loaded in SHRN. MnO2 reacted with excess H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment to increase oxygen generation, while ATO inhibited electron transfer in the aerobic respiratory chain to decrease oxygen consumption. Then, HY utilized this sufficient oxygen to produce ROS under irradiation to enhance the PDT effect. In vitro and in vivo assays confirmed that SHRN exhibits powerful and overall antitumor PDT effects. This formulation may provide an alternative strategy for the development of PDT effects in hypoxic tumor microenvironments.</p>
            <p href="#">Project 4: Bacterial contamination is a vicious, unsolved problem in wound healing. Untreated or inadequately treated wound may cause an exaggerated inflammatory responses and delayed wound repair. According to a recent assessment, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been a serious public health issue . The fatality rate of MRSA infection is 63.1%, while the nosocomial infection accounted for 60% ~ 80% of all cases. In addition, MRSA has heterogeneity and broad-spectrum resistance, which has various degrees of drugs resistance with β-lactams, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, daptomycin and linezolid. However, there are few valid anti-MRSA wound dressing on the market. Thus, it is necessary to develop a new and effective preparation for the treatment of MRSA infection. Here, we prepared an anti-MRSA hydrogel that can continuously exert antibacterial effects and promotes wound healing. Specifically, silk fibroin and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) were consisted as a nanoparticles aimed for continuously exert the antibacterial effect. Then, the nanoparticles were embedded into the rat tail collagen-based hydrogel to further improve the adhesion, sustained release ability and healing ability of the dressing. PHMB-NPs-Hydrogel not only exhibits effective anti-MRSA properties in vitro and in vivo, but also accelerates the healing of infected wounds. Simultaneously, this work provided new ideas and experimental basis for the development of effective adjuvants on the treatment of MRSA infected wounds.</p>
